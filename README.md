# UOE Racing BLDC Controller Program


The programs in this repository are designed to run on a TI Launchpad [MSP-EXP430f5529lp](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430F5529LP) board, controlling a PCB with a [DRV8323](http://www.ti.com/product/DRV8323) integrated three-phase gate driver, which itself controls a [BLDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor) (Brushless Direct-Current) motor.

**Interrupt_Code** contains our latest work on an interrupt-driven implementation.

**Polling_Code** contains 2019's functional polling-driven code.
